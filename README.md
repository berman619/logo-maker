## Description 
This is a command line application that allows users to generate SVG logos with their chosen shapes and texts. With this Logo Maker CLI, you can select a shape (Triangle, Circle, or Square), choose a color for the shape, input a text (maximum of 3 characters), and select a color for the text. The application generates an SVG file (`logo.svg`) with the specified configurations.

Here is a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wcMYAFkXGyB-M_iOYTGKMzcq5sb6tTN4/view?usp=sharing) of the application being used and the Jest testing suite being run.
